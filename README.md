I found this program in a repo created by the github user "alessandroleite". All the necessary files were scattered across in various locations. I forked them all and created one single file with all the necessary program files and the jar files with an intention of simplifying the way you fork the files and run the code on your local machine.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

*	Add the **[cloudsim-3.0.3](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim/releases/tag/cloudsim-3.0.3)** JAR file present in the **lib** folder to the project build path

## Installing

#### Running the application with IDE

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `cloudsim_round_robin` class from your IDE.

* 	Download the zip or clone the Git repository.
* 	Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
* 	Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
* 	Open Eclipse
	* File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
	* Select the project
* 	Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
* 	Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application

#### Running the application with Maven

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AnanthaRajuCprojects/CloudSim-Round-Robin.git
$ cd CloudSim-Round-Robin
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### Running the application with Executable JAR

The code can also be built into a jar and then executed/run. Once the jar is built, run the jar by double clicking on it or by using the command 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/AnanthaRajuCprojects/CloudSim-Round-Robin.git
$ cd CloudSim-Round-Robin
$ mvn package -DskipTests
$ java -jar target/CloudSim-Round-Robin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To shutdown the jar, follow the below mentioned steps on a Windows machine.

*	In command prompt execute the **jcmd** command to print a list of all running Java processes
*	**Taskkill /PID PROCESS_ID_OF_RUNNING_APP /F** execute this command by replacing the **PROCESS_ID_OF_RUNNING_APP** with the actual process id of the running jar found out from executing the previous command

## Reporting Issues/Suggest Improvements
