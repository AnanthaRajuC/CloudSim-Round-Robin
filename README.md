# CloudSim-Round-Robin
CloudSim Example with Round Robin Data center broker &amp; Round Robin Vm Allocation Policy with Circular Hosts List.

I found this program in a repo created by the github user "alessandroleite". All the necessary files were scattered across in various locations. I forked them all and created one single file with all the necessary program files and the jar files with an intention of simplifying the way you fork the files and run the code on your local machine.

There are five program files

CircularHostList.java
CloudSimExample9.java (Main Java File)
Hosts.java
RoundRobinDataCenterBroker.java
RoundRobinVmAllocationPolicy.java

I have added the necessary CloudSim JAR file, cloudim-3.0.3.jar

Run the CloudSimExample9.java file to run the program. This program works fine on Netbeans IDE as well as Eclipse IDE. It should run on any other IDE that you may use.

you can fork and clone this repository or You can directly Download the ZIP file and import this file into your IDE and run it. 

If you get an error/warning "incorrect package", click on the error/warning icon and then click on "change package declaration to cloudsim9". you will get this error/warning in the first line of the code, it's the package declaration.
